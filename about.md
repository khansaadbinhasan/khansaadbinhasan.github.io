Hi! I am Khan Saad Bin Hasan, a student of Computer Engineering who likes to learn about almost anything, I am always enthusiastic about learning new things and currently my focus is on learning about the intricacies of human mind and how we can apply the various concepts learnt in psychology and behavioral psychology in our everyday life and also in robots to provide solutions to complex problems. I am deeply interested and follow new advancements in technology mostly in high performance classical computing as well as quantum computing.

### More Information

I am currently pursuing a Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Computer Engineering. As a result, I know and have worked with a lot of algorithms in several programming languages and developed many good programming practices along with a good knowledge of software development cycle.
 
Since I have worked on big projects like AUVs and participated in high-pressure competitions like Singapore AUV Challenge, I am comfortable with working on big projects and in large teams. Also, owing to my wide range of skills and experience with many new technologies I am a good fit for projects with small teams.

Recently(around 9 months), I have become extremely interested in Artificial Intelligence, particularly Natural Language Processing and currently I am working on a sentiment analysis model to predict stock market from twitter data. Also since we are using a large amount of data I have grown accustomed to working with large datasets. 

I have also worked with Robot Operating System , Gazebo , Arduino and Raspberry Pi, I am very interested in robotics and plan to pursue it with greater vigour in recent times.  

I plan to build a smart robot that can help physically challenged people with their everyday tasks and help people with anxiety and loneliness
