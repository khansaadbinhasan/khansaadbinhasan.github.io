I am interested in Robotics, Artificial Intelligence, Computer Graphics, Simulations, Virtual Reality and Networking Concepts. During my undergrad degree, I have worked with a good number of tools and technologies and a variety of people to solve real world problems. I have built autonomous vehicles, Image Processing tools and Sentiment Analysis tools. I also have an interest in writing in general and write technical blogs about the things I learn.
   
Since I have worked on big projects like Autonomous Underwater Vehicles and Driverless Cars and participated in high-pressure competitions like Singapore AUV Challenge, I am comfortable with working on big projects and in large teams. Also, owing to my wide range of skills and experience with many new technologies I am a good fit for projects with small teams. 

Currently, I am working toward solving the complex problem of "self-driving cars" using standard robotic tools, advanced simulators and computer vision
