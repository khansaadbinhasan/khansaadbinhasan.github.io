The Projects I have made

### Turtlebot Simulation in gazebo

Wrote a ros node to control the movement of turtlebot so as to reach from current starting point to the other end of maze using LaserScan data moving turtlebot in the direction of farthest obstacle in the world.

### Stock Prediction Using Twitter

As part of my minor project, built a stock prediction model. The model correlated the stock market and sentiment from twitter data. The code can be found [here](https://github.com/khansaadbinhasan/Stock-Prediction) and the blog [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/stock-prediction-using-twitter-e432b35e14bd)
