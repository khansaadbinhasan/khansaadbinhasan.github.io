The Projects I have worked on

## Autonomous Warehouse Robot 

For my final year project, I am working on building a warehouse robot that can autonomously move things within a warehouse from one point to other by use of affordable sensors and simple algorithms

## Turtlebot Simulation in gazebo

Wrote a ros node to control the movement of turtlebot so as to reach from current starting point to the other end of maze using LaserScan data moving turtlebot in the direction of farthest obstacle in the world.

## Stock Prediction Using Twitter

As part of my minor project, built a stock prediction model. The model correlated the stock market and sentiment from twitter data. The code can be found [here](https://github.com/khansaadbinhasan/Stock-Prediction) and the blog [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/stock-prediction-using-twitter-e432b35e14bd)

## Aruco Marker Detection using OpenCV

As part of a competition, I made an aruco marker detection system, the purpose of this was to give values of angles to aruco markers from the horizontal

These are the results:
