The Projects I have worked on

## Autonomous Warehouse Robot 

For my final year project, I am working on building a warehouse robot that can autonomously move things within a warehouse from one point to other by use of affordable sensors and simple algorithms

## Self Driving Car: Project DLIVE IIT Delhi

As part of DLIVE team at IIT Delhi building a self driving car from mahindra e2o I Worked on mapping, localization and control along with overall planning of building self driving car with a Mahindra e2o at IIT Delhi

## Turtlebot Simulation in gazebo

Wrote a ros node to control the movement of turtlebot so as to reach from current starting point to the other end of maze using LaserScan data moving turtlebot in the direction of farthest obstacle in the world.

## Aruco Marker Detection using OpenCV

As part of a competition, I made an aruco marker detection system, the purpose of this was to give values of angles to aruco markers from the horizontal

These are the results:
