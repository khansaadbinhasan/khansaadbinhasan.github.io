title: What are Quantum Computers?
---

[under construction]

Computer. That word may not seem so special these days, heck its become so popular that it seems strange when people say they don't know how to use a computer. Computers are everywhere, they can fit almost everywhere- from your lap to your hands(or inside your hand!!!) but this was not always the case. The computer that sits on your lap may not have fit into the whole world in the 19th century and barely fit football fields in the second half of twentieth century. It is intriguing as to how did this change came about. Lets have a brief look at the journey of computers but before that lets define what a computer is.

Most people know what a computer is but it is very hard for them to define it. In the most rudimentary sense of the word, computer is anything that computes i.e, can do simple arithmetic calculations, Here is a more formal definition from <>:

Although the journey for the modern computer starts somewhere in the twentieth century, a need for such a machine was felt way back in the 19th century and great inventors/scientists tried their hands on building such a machine. Mechanical computers were designed at that time(most famously by Charles Babbage) and first programs were written by lady Ada Lovelace. But some computers were only conceived in designs as they were far beyond the reach of the technology at that time and were very costly and we would be better off using humans instead<charles babbage example>.

The focus then shifted to electrical computers and wires and mercury were used and IBM came into existence, the computers became better and better but still could perform only simple calculations, but with twin World Wars the scene began to change and computers were able to do calculations that were out of the reach of a single person. But these were still not enough to quench the thirst for ever increasing demand of computation and hence computers got bigger and bigger. Larger computers meant more complex structure and it became increasingly difficult to manage them. It was at this time when bugs would fly into these computers causing issues in the results(hence the use of the word bugs in modern computing).

This all changed with the introduction of electronic transistors and now the computer shrunk alot, but still they were very huge, but there potential was now known and a great amount of fierce competition(coupled with a lot of scifi) lead to the development of smaller and smaller computers all thanks to shrinking transistor sizes. This was noticed by everyone but thomas Moore quantized this and made the observation that every 18 mths the size of transistors shrunk by 10%. 

Moore's law as it came to be called held true for many years(and still does unless you are reading after 2020) but here is a problem with Moore's law: Transistors can't keep shrinking they are bound to hit that spot where quantum effects come into the picture and when quantum physics come into the picture there is a large amount of uncertainty associated(get it!). Computers need to be dead certain about the answer, else computers will be useless.

According to current estimates the transistors will stop getting any smaller after 2024. Since around that period an individual transistor will be even smaller than 10 atoms long(let that sink in), if we were to make the transistor any smaller quantum effects will come into play, hence the traditional(or classical) approaches to computing will stop their exponential march in terms of improve in performance.

Many solutions can be provided to the above problem- one of them being atomic transistors(still a theory but a good one). Or we can use new types of computing aka quantum computing. But this does not mean that quantum computers are needed because classical computers cannot get any better. The reason for their existence and need is far more complex and fascinating than this.

H2: Quantum computers

Quantum computers are not here to replace classical computing, that is not what they are meant for, they are pretty different from classical computers and have their own style of functioning. They may never be able to beat normal computers at most of the problems we solve with classical computers. Then why are they needed.

The reason is that quantum computers are here to solve some bigger problems and not for watching cat videos on the internet(**sigh**). Quantum computers can be used to solve problems that will be unsolvable by classical computers. Problems like Travelling Salesman problem where the paths requried to traverse increase exponentially and problems where a quantum solution is needed like quantum modelling. Actually one of the first applications for which quantum computers were conceived(by the great Richard Feinmann) was to study quantum particles. Since if we can model a quantum particle mathematically and then create its simulation in the computer, then we can perform all sort of experiment on them which would be impossible otherwise.
